Loan Calculator
--
This work is a literate program to calculate an amortization schedule that produces JavaScript source code. The author used the amazing [org-mode](http://org-mode.org) that works inside the powerful GNU Emacs editor.

The HTML program documentation is at [http://petermoresi.github.io/loan-calculator-js/](http://petermoresi.github.io/loan-calculator-js/).

The demo page is at [petermoresi.github.io/loan-calculator-js/loan-calculator.html](http://petermoresi.github.io/loan-calculator-js/loan-calculator.html)

For the source code (e.g literate program) please see [amortize.js.org](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petermoresi/loan-calculator-js/master/amortize.js.org).

The HTML theme for the program documentation is greatly improved through the use of [org-html-themes](https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes).
